## Project Overview

This is a new project template. Update this section with a brief description of what this project does and its main purpose.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Document any system requirements or dependencies needed before development (Node.js version, Python version, etc.).

### Installation

# Add installation commands here
```

### Environment Configuration

Document any required environment variables or configuration files needed for development.

## Common Development Commands

Document the commands commonly used during development:

```bash

# TODO: Add build command

# Run tests
# TODO: Add test command

# Run tests for a specific file
# TODO: Add single test command

# Lint code
# TODO: Add lint command

# Start development server / Run the application
# TODO: Add dev/run command
```

## Project Architecture

### Directory Structure

Document the high-level directory organization:

```
/
├── src/                    # Main source code
